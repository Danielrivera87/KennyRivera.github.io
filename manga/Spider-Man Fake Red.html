                <p>The story begins with a police car chase in New York City. The criminals try to speed up their car, and are in the process of hitting an old lady crossing the street. Before that can happen Spider-Man lands in front of the old lady. Spider-Man webs up their path with the nearby buildings. The criminals' car is driven into the webbed barrier, resulting in them and their car getting flipped upside down. Spider-Man helps the old lady pick up her dropped groceries, and swings off as nearby civilians praise him. The old lady who has been saved by Spider-Man is interviewed on the news on tv. Yu Onomae is introduced as he leaves his home while his father tells him is going to be late if he doesn't hurry. Yu skips school and walks to his local gym to rock climb. As he does this he reflects on his life as an outcast. He idolizes Spider-Man while he rock climbs, and when he leaves the gym he likes a picture of Spider-Man on his phone. While passing an alley, he witnesses his classmate Toby getting bullied by older students. Yu hesitates on helping him, checking his phone seeing Spider-Man. The bully punches Toby in the face as Yu is about to intervene. The bullies leave and Toby walks out, Yu attempts to apologize to Toby feeling guilty for not attempting to help him. Toby leaves telling Yu to not worry about it and that he didn't get his hopes up anyway. Yu walks into the alley and finds Toby's school ID on the ground. While picking up the school ID he spots something by a nearby dumpster. He picks it up and discovers that it is Spider-Man's suit</p>
